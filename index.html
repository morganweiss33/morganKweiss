     As a soon to be college graduate I saw the importance of knowing how to
      host a website and connect that to a domain. This site is hosted on my GitHub account

        <h2 class="mb-5">Passion for Technology</h2>
        <h3>It all started my junior year of high school... </h3>
        <p>
          During my sophomore year of high school, I started helping my grandparents
          with their iPhones and iPads they were getting for birthdays and Christmas.
           It turned into weekly visits and teaching them social media as well.
           During one of my weekly visits my grandma invited her friend over because
           she needed help since her family did not live in the area. I started to
           wonder how many other seniors are out in my community that would benefit
           from this type of service. I thought about this and decided after I became
           the president of my high school key club (beginning of my junior year) I
           would start a program to help seniors in our community with technology and
           social media and call it “TechConnect”. TechConnect not only provided a
           much-needed service in our community but it was able to provide community
            service hours for Key Club members. I had meetings with my advisor and
             high school principal to get approval; meetings in the community to
              find a place to host the event; and a meeting with the City Mayor
              to get the word out and see if he had additional ideas on how to
               promote it. I reached out to newspapers and ended up being interviewed
               by local newspapers four different times to promote TechConnect.
               TechConnect has not only provides tech support for seniors but it has
               also started friendships, bridged two different generations, and with
                the repeat visitors each month it is also a place to meet. Six years later
                 I am proud to say this program is still running and now occurs twice a month.
               Over my winter breaks I still attend the January session. This program is what created my spark
               for technology and what eventually led me to purse my current degree at the University
                of Dayton.
